Absolutely. Here is the comparison of advertising buy models, reformatted into a clear markdown table structure.

The primary models for buying digital ad inventory are defined by **how** the transaction occurs (Direct vs. Programmatic) and **whether** the inventory is reserved (Guaranteed vs. Non-Guaranteed).

## Comparison of Advertising Buy Models

| Transaction Model | Definition | Negotiation/Pricing | Inventory Guarantee | Key Benefits for Advertiser |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional Direct Buy** (Non-Programmatic) | Manual, one-to-one sale negotiated directly with a publisher's sales team via an Insertion Order (IO). | Manual negotiation of fixed price (e.g., CPM, CPD) and terms. | **Guaranteed.** Inventory is reserved and secured. | Access to **premium, unique inventory**, high customization, and assured placement. |
| **Programmatic Guaranteed** (Automated Direct) | A direct, one-to-one deal where transaction and ad serving are **automated** through programmatic platforms. | Pre-negotiated fixed price (CPM) and terms. | **Guaranteed.** A fixed volume of inventory is reserved for the buyer. | **Efficiency of automation** combined with the **assurance of premium inventory** and fixed price. |
| **Preferred Deal** (Programmatic Direct, Non-Guaranteed) | A programmatic deal offering a single advertiser a **"first look"** at a publisher's inventory at a negotiated fixed price before it goes to a wider auction. | Negotiated fixed price (floor price). | **Non-Guaranteed.** No commitment to buy or reserve a volume of impressions. | **Priority access** to quality inventory and data without a volume commitment. |
| **Private Marketplace (PMP)** (Programmatic, Non-Guaranteed) | An **invite-only, real-time auction** where a select group of advertisers bid on a publisher's designated inventory. | Auction-based, with a minimum **price floor** set by the publisher. | **Non-Guaranteed.** Inventory is not reserved; the highest bidder wins. | **Exclusivity** (less competition than an Open Auction), **greater control** over inventory quality, and better targeting. |
| **Open Auction (RTB)** (Programmatic, Non-Guaranteed) | A **public, real-time auction** where any advertiser can bid on a wide, expansive pool of publisher inventory. | Auction-based (**Real-Time Bidding** or RTB), where the highest bid wins the impression. | **Non-Guaranteed.** No commitment on impressions or price. | **Maximized reach and scale,** **cost efficiency** (only pay for the winning bid), and high flexibility. |

## Other Transaction Models (Pricing)

These models define **what** the advertiser pays for and are often applied within any of the transaction models listed above.

| Pricing Model | Description | Primary Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **CPC** (Cost Per Click) | The advertiser pays only when a user **clicks** on the ad. | Driving immediate **website traffic** and engagement. |
| **CPA** (Cost Per Action/Acquisition) | The advertiser pays only when a user completes a specific desired action (e.g., a signup, download, or purchase). | Focusing on **performance** and direct return on investment (ROI). |
| **CPL** (Cost Per Lead) | The advertiser pays for each qualified lead generated (e.g., a form submission with contact information). | **Lead generation**, common in B2B. |

This is a common question, and the answer depends on how strictly you define a Demand-Side Platform (DSP).

In short: **Google Ads is not considered a true, full-fledged DSP, but it contains similar automated buying features for Google's own inventory.**

Google's dedicated, enterprise-level DSP is a separate product called **Display & Video 360 (DV360)**.

Here is a breakdown of the differences:

| Feature | Google Ads (Google Display Network) | Display & Video 360 (DV360) | True DSP Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | User-friendly platform for search, display, video, and app ads, focused on Google's ecosystem. | Enterprise-grade platform for sophisticated, large-scale programmatic media buying. | Yes |
| **Inventory Access** | Primarily limited to Google's own inventory (Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and the Google Display Network). | Accesses Google inventory **plus** inventory from dozens of other major ad exchanges, ad networks, and Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs). | Full |
| **Bidding Model** | Automated and manual bidding for various objectives (CPC, CPA, CPM). | Advanced Real-Time Bidding (RTB) on multiple exchanges, Programmatic Guaranteed, and Private Marketplace (PMP) deals. | Full |
| **Targeting & Control** | Robust but more simplified targeting options (keywords, demographics, interests). | Advanced, granular control over bidding, placement, audience segmentation, and more sophisticated data integration (first, second, and third-party data). | Full |
| **Best For** | Small to mid-sized businesses, self-service users, and direct-response campaigns. | Large advertisers, agencies, and those requiring multi-channel campaigns with maximum reach and control. | N/A |

### Conclusion

* **Google Ads** offers programmatic buying and automated bidding, but its scope is generally limited to the **Google ecosystem**. It acts as an **ad network** with programmatic features.
* **DV360** is Google's actual, full-featured **Demand-Side Platform (DSP)**, designed to buy ad inventory from nearly all major exchanges and publishers, including those outside of the Google network.
