# Data Platform Updates - dbt & Data Mesh

## Summary
Successfully added comprehensive content about **dbt (Data Build Tool)** and **Data Mesh** architecture to `data_platform.html`.

## Changes Made

### 1. dbt (Data Build Tool) Content

#### Added in Data Processing Section (Line ~386)
- Quick reference in SQL Processing subsection
- Tags: SQL, Transformation, Testing, Documentation

#### New Dedicated dbt Section (Line ~434)
Comprehensive section including:
- **Core Features**
  - SQL-based Transformations
  - Version Control (Git integration)
  - Data Testing
  - Documentation & Lineage

- **Key Capabilities**
  - Incremental Models
  - Macros & Jinja templating
  - Snapshots (Type 2 SCDs)
  - Package ecosystem

- **Best Practices**
  - Modular design (staging → intermediate → mart layers)
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Naming conventions
  - Incremental processing
  - Package leveraging

- **Platform Support**
  - Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
  - Databricks, Spark
  - PostgreSQL, SQL Server
  - Trino, Starburst
  - 30+ database adapters

- **Deployment Options**
  - dbt Cloud (managed service)
  - dbt Core (open source)
  - CI/CD integrations

#### Data Governance Integration (Line ~2467)
- Added dbt auto-generated lineage graphs
- Data product discovery mention

#### Data Quality Integration (Line ~2510)
- Added dbt built-in tests (uniqueness, not null, relationships)
- Custom data quality checks

### 2. Data Mesh Architecture Content

#### Location
**Moved to Data Governance & Best Practices Section (Line ~2410)**
- Positioned just before "Data Modeling & Storage Best Practices"
- Part of the governance section to emphasize its governance model

#### New Dedicated Section (Originally at Line ~697, now at Line ~2410)
Comprehensive section including:

- **Four Core Principles**
  1. Domain-Oriented Decentralization
  2. Data as a Product
  3. Self-Serve Data Platform
  4. Federated Computational Governance

- **Data Product Characteristics**
  - Discoverable (catalog, metadata)
  - Addressable (unique identity, interfaces)
  - Trustworthy (SLAs, data contracts)
  - Interoperable (standardized formats)
  - Secure & Governed (access control, compliance)

- **Team Structure**
  - Domain data product teams
  - Platform team
  - Governance guild
  - Cross-functional teams
  - Embedded data engineers

- **Technology Enablers**
  - Data catalogs: DataHub, Amundsen, Atlan
  - Data contracts: Great Expectations, Soda
  - Compute fabrics: Trino, Starburst, Dremio
  - Policy engines: Open Policy Agent (OPA)
  - Orchestration: Airflow, Dagster, Prefect

- **Benefits & Challenges**
  - Benefits: Domain agility, scalability, reduced bottlenecks
  - Challenges: Cultural shift, tooling maturity, governance complexity
  - Best for large organizations with multiple domains

- **When to Consider Data Mesh**
  - Multiple business domains with distinct needs
  - Centralized team bottleneck
  - Faster time-to-market needed
  - Strong platform engineering capability
  - Leadership support for transformation

#### Data Governance Integration (Line ~2468)
- Added Data Mesh data product discovery

### 3. Metadata Updates

#### Keywords (Line 11)
Added "dbt" and "data mesh" to meta keywords

#### Executive Summary (Line 169)
Added "dbt" to open source tools list

## Visual Organization

### dbt Section
- Purple/pink gradient theme
- Three-column layout for Best Practices, Platform Support, and Deployment
- Clear subsections with icons
- Comprehensive coverage of features and capabilities

### Data Mesh Section
- Teal/cyan gradient theme
- Two-column layout for principles and characteristics
- Three-column layout for team structure, technology, and benefits
- Highlighted "When to Consider" section with blue border

## Benefits of These Additions

### For dbt
1. **Visibility**: dbt is now properly represented as a key transformation tool
2. **Integration**: Shows how dbt fits into the broader data platform
3. **Practical Value**: Includes best practices and deployment options
4. **Governance**: Highlights dbt's role in testing and lineage

### For Data Mesh
1. **Paradigm Shift**: Introduces modern architectural approach
2. **Comprehensive**: Covers all four core principles
3. **Practical**: Includes technology enablers and decision criteria
4. **Balanced**: Discusses both benefits and challenges

## Testing
✅ No linting errors
✅ HTML structure validated
✅ Consistent with existing page design
✅ Responsive layout maintained

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Consider adding dbt code examples
- Add data mesh implementation case studies
- Create comparison tables between centralized and mesh approaches
- Add links to dbt documentation and data mesh resources
