### **White Paper: Architecting Petabyte-Scale Data Platforms**

**A Comparative Analysis of AWS, GCP, Azure, and Databricks for Enterprise Data Processing, Reporting, and Analytics**

**October 14, 2025**

### **Executive Summary**

Processing petabyte-scale datasets that include metadata, reference data, and log data requires a strategic shift from traditional data warehousing to a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective **data lakehouse architecture**. This approach merges the low-cost storage of a data lake with the powerful data management and performance features of a data warehouse. This white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of implementing such a platform on the four leading cloud data platforms: **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Databricks**.

We will explore the specific services, architectural patterns, and strategies for each platform across the entire data lifecycle: ingestion, storage, processing, and serving for reporting and analytics. Furthermore, we will provide a detailed breakdown of the required infrastructure size, strategic considerations, and estimated monthly costs for storage, network, and compute, enabling organizations to make an informed decision based on their technical requirements, existing expertise, and budget. The core finding is that while all platforms are capable, they offer different strengths in serverless capabilities, integration, and specialized tooling, leading to significant variations in operational overhead and cost.

### **1. The Unified Data Platform Strategy: The Lakehouse**

The foundational strategy for all four platforms is the data lakehouse. This modern architecture is designed to handle the three V's of big data: volume, velocity, and variety. It avoids data silos by creating a single source of truth for all data types‚Äîstructured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

The key stages of a lakehouse-based data pipeline are:

1.  **Ingestion**: Raw data (logs, metadata, reference data) is ingested into a central, scalable storage layer. This can be done via streaming for real-time data like logs or in batches for less-frequently updated data.
2.  **Storage**: A cloud object store (like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) serves as the data lake. Data is stored in its raw format and then transformed into an open, optimized format like **Apache Parquet**. A transactional layer like **Delta Lake** (foundational to Databricks) or **Apache Iceberg** is applied on top to provide reliability, ACID transactions, and performance.
3.  **Processing & Transformation**: Compute engines (primarily Apache Spark) are used to clean, enrich, and transform the raw data into curated, business-ready datasets.
4.  **Serving**: The curated data is made available to end-users through various tools:
    * **BI & Reporting**: High-speed SQL engines or data warehouses.
    * **Ad-Hoc Analysis**: Serverless query engines for data exploration.
    * **Machine Learning**: Notebooks and ML platforms to train models directly on the data.

    * **Simplified Ingestion**: **Auto Loader** automatically and incrementally processes files as they arrive in cloud storage.
    * **Streaming**: Natively integrated **Structured Streaming**.
* **Storage**: Databricks runs on top of your cloud storage (S3, GCS, or ADLS). The core of its storage strategy is **Delta Lake**, an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions, time travel, and performance optimizations to Parquet files.
* **Processing**: The **Databricks Photon engine** is a high-performance, C++-based engine that is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs but runs significantly faster. All processing is done within the Databricks workspace.
* **Serving**:
    * **Data Warehouse**: **Databricks SQL** is a serverless data warehouse that provides record-breaking performance for BI and reporting directly on the lakehouse.

### **3. Infrastructure Size, Strategy, and Cost Analysis**

Estimating costs for a petabyte-scale platform is complex. The following analysis is based on an initial 1 PB dataset, with a total of **3 PB** stored (raw + processed) and assumes significant daily processing and analytics workloads.

#### **3.1. Storage**

* **Infrastructure Size**: At least 3-5 PB of cloud object storage capacity.
* **Strategy**:
    * **Compression & Columnar Format**: Storing data in compressed Parquet or Delta/Iceberg format is essential and can reduce storage footprint by up to 80% compared to raw text formats.
    * **Automated Tiering**: Use services like S3 Intelligent-Tiering, GCS Autoclass, or ADLS Lifecycle Management to automatically move less-accessed data to cheaper storage tiers.
* **Estimated Monthly Cost (for 3 PB)**:
    * **AWS S3**: ~$62,000/month (assuming a blended rate with tiering).
    * **GCP GCS**: ~$54,000/month (assuming a blended rate with Autoclass).
    * **Azure ADLS**: ~$55,000/month (assuming a blended "cool" tier average).
    * **Databricks**: The storage cost is passed through from the underlying cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

#### **3.2. Network**

* **Infrastructure Size**: Not a provisioned size but a usage-based cost.
* **Strategy**:
    * **Minimize Egress**: The highest cost is data transfer *out* of the cloud. Design the architecture to keep all processing and analytics within the same cloud region.
    * **Use Private Endpoints**: Utilize private networking to avoid public internet charges and enhance security.
* **Estimated Monthly Cost**: Assuming 50 TB of egress to an external system per month, the cost would be roughly **$4,000 - $5,000/month** on any of the platforms, as egress rates are competitively priced. **This is a critical cost to monitor.**

#### **3.3. Compute**

* **Infrastructure Size**: Highly elastic and workload-dependent. Involves both large, transient clusters for batch ETL and provisioned or serverless engines for queries.
* **Strategy**:
    * **Embrace Serverless**: Use serverless options (AWS Glue, BigQuery, Synapse Serverless, Databricks Serverless) where possible to pay only for execution time and eliminate idle cluster costs.
    * **Use Spot/Preemptible VMs**: For managed Spark clusters (EMR, Dataproc), using spot instances can cut compute costs by 70-90% for fault-tolerant workloads.
    * **Query Optimization**: In query-based pricing models (BigQuery, Athena), optimizing queries and partitioning data directly reduces costs.
* **Estimated Monthly Cost (Highly Variable)**:
    * **AWS (EMR + Redshift)**: A mix of a large daily EMR job and a provisioned Redshift cluster could range from **$40,000 to $90,000+**.
    * **GCP (Dataproc + BigQuery)**: If heavy on BigQuery scanning, costs could be high, but for many workloads, the serverless model is cheaper. A typical range might be **$35,000 to $80,000**.
    * **Azure (Synapse)**: The integrated nature of Synapse can offer cost efficiencies. A similar workload might cost **$40,000 to $85,000**.
    * **Databricks**: Databricks has its own pricing (DBUs) on top of the cloud provider's VM costs. Its high-performance Photon engine can reduce the required cluster size and job duration, often leading to a **lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** despite the license fee. A comparable workload could range from **$50,000 to $100,000** (inclusive of cloud VM costs).

### **4. Conclusion and Recommendations**

All four platforms provide robust, scalable solutions for building a petabyte-scale data lakehouse. The best choice depends on an organization's specific needs:

* **AWS** is an excellent choice for organizations that want maximum flexibility and a vast ecosystem of services. It's the most mature platform but may require more effort to integrate services.
* **GCP** is ideal for companies that want a highly integrated, serverless-first, and AI/ML-focused platform. BigQuery's power and simplicity are a major draw for SQL-heavy analytics.
* **Azure** is a strong contender for enterprises already heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. Azure Synapse provides a compelling, unified analytics workspace.
* **Databricks** is the best choice for organizations that want a best-in-class, unified Lakehouse platform focused on open standards, which can run on any cloud. Its performance and collaborative environment are its key differentiators, often justifying the premium price through improved productivity and lower TCO.

Ultimately, a proof-of-concept (POC) on one or two of these platforms with a representative dataset is the most effective way to validate performance, estimate costs accurately, and determine the best fit for your production and analytics use cases.
